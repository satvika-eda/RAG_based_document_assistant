# Intelligent Document Assistant 

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot using Streamlit. The chatbot can answer user queries by retrieving context from uploaded documents (PDF or text) and generating responses using a language model. It supports processing and storing documents in a vector database, enabling efficient similarity searches.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Supports PDF and text files for document uploads.
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from uploaded files and splits it into manageable chunks for vector storage.
- **Custom Embeddings**: Uses a tailored embedding model for document indexing and similarity search.
- **Query Handling**: Handles natural language queries with context-based responses.
- **Dynamic Interface**: Interactive chat interface using Streamlit.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users about unsupported file types, empty files, and large uploads.

### Execution
1. Replace the `REPLACE_ME` for the OPENAI_API_KEY variable in the config.py by creating a new openai key.
2. Execute the App using :
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamApp.py
    ```
3. Start the application using the command above. The interface will open in your browser.
4. Upload a file (PDF or text) using the "ðŸ“Ž Attach File" button.
5. Once the file is processed, you can ask questions related to its content in the chat box.
6. View responses generated by the chatbot in real-time.
